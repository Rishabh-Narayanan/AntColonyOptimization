# Ant Colony Optimzation for Traveling Salesman

## Summary
GUI Program to simulate both a naive and ant colony optimized solution to the traveling salesman problem. A set of points in 2d space are randomly generated and different paths are tested. The best path is painted onto the screen.

### Naive
Statistics such as expected and elapsed time as well as total and completed paths are displayed

### ACO
Statistics such as elapsed time as well as total and completed paths are displayed.

## Compile and Run
To compile, use <code>javac</code>:
```
javac -d out *.java
```
Then run using <code>java</code>:
```
java -cp out Main [-flags]
```

<hr/>

## Runtime flags
* <code>--naive</code>: Runs the brute force algorithm on a set of random points (generated by a seed).
* <code>--aco</code>: Runs the ACO algorithm on a set of random points (generated by a seed)
* <code>-n=?</code>: A number that determines how many points to generate on the map. Defaults to 10
* <code>-s=?</code>: The random seed that generates how many points to run. Defaults to random.
* <code>-a=?</code>: How many ants will run in the aco algorithm. Ignored if <code>--aco</code> flag is not also specified
* <code>-i=?</code>: How many iterations of ants will run in the aco algorithm. Ignored if <code>--aco</code> flag is not also specified
